I have a 'Added the django-bootstrap4 app' commit. 
Then I edited base.html file by adding bootstrap styles.
Then I tried to run the project but apparently bootstrap4 wasn't installed for some reason because I saw errors when tried to use bootstrap in templates.
After that, I ran django-bootstrap4 installation command once again. And Django got updated from 2.2.28 to 5.0 without even asking me
So I decided to stash changes in base.html, return to a 'Added the django-bootstrap4 app' commit to discard the updating of Django.
I did that but Django version remained the same.
Why?
So in a few words, I resetted to the last commit but it didn't reset.
I tried to reset to even earlier commit but the Django version is still 5.0.
Resume: django doesn't roll back with the commits for some reason
